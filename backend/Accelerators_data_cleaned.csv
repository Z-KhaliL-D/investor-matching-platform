Algeria Startup Challenge (ASC),"On the scene since 2018, ASC reckons it’s the biggest entrepreneurial competition and accelerator in Algeria. It runs a hybrid programme—so you can apply online, but expect proper face-to-face elements if you make the cut. Each year, hundreds get thrown into open innovation challenges and fast-track mentorship, with industry partners chipping in. The skills development’s broad, from sales to finance to marketing, and the 7th edition launches in April 2025. ASC’s known for helping startups bag contracts, subsidies and exposure to key players in the Algiers startup ecosystem. If you’re willing to roll your sleeves up and move quickly, this is a major pathway into the city’s growing networks.","01 avenue de l’indépendance, étage 03, Sidi Mhamed, Alger",Cap Cowork Incubator,2018,Active,"Technology, agriculture, health, renewable energy","Over 3,500 participants across 6 editions",Early-stage to growth-stage,Contact@algeriastartupchallenge.com,https://algeriastartupchallenge.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/algeria-startup-challenge/,,,,,
Algeria Startup Fund (ASF),"ASF isn’t technically an accelerator, but you can’t skip them if you’re talking about funding. It’s the government’s main startup fund, set up in late 2020 to funnel seed capital and help startups go from idea to scale without running out of steam mid-way. They’ve recently teamed up with giants like Algérie Télécom to pump serious cash—think about 1.5 billion Algerian dinars—into AI, cybersecurity and robotics. ASF usually works hand-in-glove with accelerators like Algeria Venture, so it’s often the next stop after you’re done refining that cap table and looking for your next big funding round.","Algiers, Algeria",Algerian government initiative,2020,Active,"Sector-agnostic (Technology, Biotech, Renewable Energy, Fintech)",Over 100 startups financed,"Pre-seed, Seed, Growth",contact@asf.dz,https://asf.dz/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/algerian-startup-fund,Over 139 funding requests processed,"+213 21636400

Algeria Venture (A-Venture),"A-Venture is the current big player amongst Algiers accelerators—it’s state-owned, founded in late 2020 and calls the shots when it comes to supporting startups in AI, cybersecurity and robotics. The programme is split into incubation for ideas that need proper nurturing, and acceleration for those ready to scale and chase down investment. They pitch themselves as the flagship for national innovation, but there’s global reach too, with links into “Google for Startups MENA” and beyond. Highlights for A-Venture include being a major source of mentorship, networking and venture capital, all heavily bolstered by the government’s relentless drive to create 20,000 AI sector startups. Their success stories include Opticharge (logistics tech), Antaress (renewables), and Iminum Bio (biotech)—real proof for founders building something with legs, not just another app.","Dounia Parc, Dely brahim, Algiers, Algeria​",Initiative of the Algerian government (Ministry of Knowledge Economy and Startups),2020,Active,"AI, Cybersecurity, Robotics, Open Innovation, Technology, Knowledge Economy",68+ startups supported across multiple cohorts,Early-stage to growth-stage,hello@www.aventure.dz​,https://www.aventure.dz/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/algeriaventure,,+213 770 666 333​,,,
Founder Institute Algeria,"Brand new for 2025, Founder Institute Algeria plugs local founders straight into a global network—over 200 cities strong and rooted in Silicon Valley. The accelerator has a reputation for turning bright ideas into fundable startups, with a process-driven approach that leaves nothing to chance. Leading the charge locally is Amel Touhami (CEO of Emir Synergy LLC), and thanks to FI’s format, you can expect a good mix of remote and in-person action. The main “Core” programme pushes founders through milestones that lift them from pre-seed, upskilling fast and prepping for VC meetings, term sheets and all the fun paperwork. Serious about growing with structure, but also big on mindset and connections—no flannel, just practical learning and warm intros to those with cheque books.","Algiers, Algeria",Global organisation with local leadership by Amel Touhami,2025,Active,"Technology, Entrepreneurship",,Idea and pre-seed stages,,https://fi.co/apply/algiers,https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-founder-institute,"7,500+ (Global)",,110+ (Global),,
UNDP Algeria Accelerator Lab,"This one’s a bit different—less about chasing unicorn exits, more about solving social and environmental headaches in the real world. The UNDP Accelerator Lab forms part of a global strategy to spot and nurture change makers working in social entrepreneurship and the circular economy. It’s attached to the United Nations, which gives founders a crack at international resources and credibility, not to mention the odd invite to global summits. They’ve worked closely with things like the Coronhackthon (COVID-19 action), partnering up with more commercial accelerators in Algiers for impact and experimentation. For founders looking to make an actual difference, it’s a decent pick—and one tipped by Arageek as a sign of Algeria’s increasingly collaborative approach.","Algiers, Algeria",United Nations Development Programme,,Active,"Social entrepreneurship, circular economy",,Experimentation and early-stage support,,https://www.undp.org/acceleratorlabs/undp-algeria-accelerator-lab,https://www.linkedin.com/company/undp-accelerator-labs/,,,,,
Bahrain FinTech Bay,"If you’re building anything remotely connected to financial technology, Bahrain FinTech Bay is the ecosystem’s crown jewel. With its airy Arcapita HQ and a huge volume of regional fintechs under one roof, this place feels more like a mini financial district than a traditional accelerator. Backed by the Economic Development Board, it’s both a coworking home and a launchpad—with slick support from the Central Bank’s innovation unit and direct regulatory sandbox access for startups chasing the next big thing in payments or crypto. EazyPay and CoinMENA are just a couple of heavyweight alumni. The vibe is competitive but supportive, and you’ll benefit at every stage from curated events, labs, and that all-important corridor chat with investors.

Brinc MENA,"With its roots in Hong Kong and a sharp focus on IoT, Web3, MedTech, and smart cities, Brinc MENA is one of those accelerators with global ambition—but a serious stake in Bahrain. Their model is hands-on, combining a three-month in-person programme, healthy seed funding (thanks partly to a meaty $130 million raise in 2021), and real help from mentors and manufacturing partners. The network stretches across MENA, linking up with heavyweight partners like Batelco, Omantel, and NEOM’s Oxagon. Brinc favours practical founders tackling big, technical challenges; if you’re in MedTech, Food/Agri-tech, logistics, or just live and breathe smart cities, you’ll find solid guidance here. Application is rolling, and they’re dead keen on founders ready to scale fast, not just tinker. Past grads include Procural (a B2B juggernaut) and Bezat, who both cracked top slots in StartUp Bahrain’s recent pitch contests. Frankly, if your startup can hack it at Brinc, you’re probably in for a decent shot at top-tier seed funding and investor intros.","Government Ave, Manama, Bahrain",Manav Gupta (Global founder),"2014 (Global), 2018 (Bahrain)",Active,"MedTech, Smart Cities, Food/Agri-tech, Logistics, Web3",109 investments globally,early-stage startups,programsmena@brinc.io,https://www.brinc.io/mena/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/brincmena/,109,+973 3969 1921,4,,

The focus is 100% cloud: SaaS, infrastructure, and anything built to run and scale in modern environments. While specific figures are a bit thin on the ground, being plugged into AWS resources and advisory is no small win for startups eyeing scalable growth or prepping for their first proper funding round. Those tackling hardcore cloud challenges or wanting to tap the Bahraini government’s digital-friendly mood should give C5 Accelerate a hard look.","Manama, Bahrain",Andre Pienaar,2015,Active,Cloud Technology,,Early Stage Venture,enquiries@c5capital.com,http://www.c5accelerate.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/c5-capital,4,+973 1668 8888,,,
CH9,"CH9 is one of the OGs in Manama, mixing business acceleration with a thriving coworking scene. Founded by Mohammed Al Tawash back in 2015, it’s built for hustlers who want more than just somewhere to plug in their laptops. What makes CH9 work is the community-first mindset—founders, mentors, and VC types cross paths over coffee and swap war stories. There’s not much public detail about specific investments or exit numbers, but its reputation remains strong, likely because they keep things founder-friendly and adapt as the local startup scene shifts. If you’re keen on growing your startup and wouldn’t mind some practical help or a ready-made founders’ circle, CH9 is a reliable pick.","Amwaj Islands, Bahrain",Mohammed Al Tawash,2015,Active,"Technology, General",,Various,,https://seller.kadinwonosobo.org/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/corporate-hub,,,,,

Born out of a partnership with Tamkeen, this accelerator sees hundreds of applications every year, boiling down to two hotly contested cohorts full of rising tech, fintech, health, and e-commerce startups. If you’re accepted, expect a four-month regime of mentoring, networking, and access to $32,000 in seed capital—plus, bonus AWS credits and legal support that’s honestly worth its weight in gold at the early stage. Their alumni have gone on to raise further rounds, with companies like SINC and Dalooni catching follow-on VC and angel investment. You’ll need to commit to being in Manama for the entire program (no dialling in from a holiday).

Kickstart Bahrain,"Kickstart Bahrain sets itself apart with a flexible, hybrid programme that caters to founders wherever they are—even those running things virtually from abroad.

Weekly live sessions, plus self-paced modules, cap off with a pitch to investors and some proper support—workspace, company setup, and post-programme help included. What really impresses is that it’s totally free, lowering the barrier for early-stage startups who might otherwise miss out.
